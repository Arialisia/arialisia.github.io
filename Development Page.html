					I have been exploring my creative side in terms of graphic design/flyer/logo making 
					as well as exploring modeling and talent agencies. In regards to empathy, there is not much to
					develop as it is something that comes naturally to me. I tend to sometimes be unable to fully 
					control my emotions so I have been working on that. I am also a naturally open-minded
					person. I always try to see the world from other person's point of views. Im sometimes however stuck 
					in my ways in terms of certain topics so I have been learning how to remain unbiased in certain situations.</strong>

				<td style='vertical-align:top'>
					<strong style='color:pink'><br/>Chapter 4, "Achieve Your Goals", described a conversation between Micheal and Charlie emphasizing goal setting. Charlie gave Micheal some advice on his gardening. 
					This advice is applicable to my life as he stated that, &#40;Rohn & Widener, 2005&#41;, once a flower bloom it still needs water and sun to keep from witing,
					which I interpreted to mean even when I achieve my goals I have to ensure to do what is needed to ensure I do not fall off track. They went
					further to discuss goal setting. An important piece of advice seen in the chapter was to write down your goals as when written down you are more 
					likely to achieve. Chapter 5 highlighted, "The Proper Use of Time". Chapter 5 really evoked a sense of purpose in me.<strong style='color:black'> It allowed me to think
					that I should give each day purpose and spend my days wisely as Charlie stated because each day I spend is one less day I have. This chapter really
					spoke to me in terms of the, "time management trap". I too like Micheal spend majority of my days getting by and doing the urgent rather than
					the  important instead of managing my time well and being the designer of my own life. Chapter 6, "Surround Yourself With the Best People", was personally
					my favourite chapter. Here we see where Charlie is once again sharing his knowledge of success learned from Mr. Davis with Micheal. The questions asked
					in the chapter such as who am I around and what effect are they having on me are very important questions everyone should ask themselves.
					I personally made it a habit to surround my self with positive, hard working indivduals who have some similar values or traits to me.
					Placing certain individuals into categories as to know if you should limit your association with them as Charlie advised Micheal to so is something
					I can apply to my life as I know that they can affect my development. Finally, Chapter 7, "Be a Life Long Learner", Charlie told Micheal that a successful person
					is always a life long learner. This is something I always aimed at being from the get go. Simply because I love to learn. A quote I really reflected on 
					in this chapter was, 'Formal Education will make you a living. Self education will make you a fortune." This is very much accurate and I aim to constanly 
					widen my knowledge in any field which I desire. This chapter really encouraged me to start reading more books rather than to watch television. Number one on the list being, My Bible.
